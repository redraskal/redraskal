## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben! A software engineer with a passion for technology and problem-solving.

My current interests include full-stack development, security research/tooling, and developer tooling.

When I'm not coding, you can find me creating music in FL Studio or writing about tech on my blog.

I enjoy thought-provoking shows like Severance, Slow Horses, and Silo (I highly recommend the books too).
